# Synergy

An AI-powered relationship advisor that helps couples understand their dynamic through the lens of Myers-Briggs personality types.

## What it does

Enter your personality type and your partner's, and Synergy generates a SWOT analysis of your relationship—strengths you can build on, weaknesses to watch for, opportunities for growth, and threats that could cause friction if left unaddressed.

After the analysis, you can chat with the AI to dig deeper: ask why you argue about certain topics, how to communicate better given your types, or what patterns to look out for.

## Why it exists

Relationships are hard. Understanding *why* they're hard—especially when both people have good intentions—is even harder. Synergy uses personality frameworks as a starting point for that conversation.
